SEND + MORE = MONEY
===================
Solve SEND + MORE = MONEY type of problems

How to Run?
------------
Call solve([0, S, E, N, D], [0, M, O, R, E], [M, O, N, E, Y]).

SPANNING TREE PROBLEM
=====================
Finds spanning tree of the graph given

How to Run?
------------
1. One edge can be represented as a/b where 'a' and 'b' are 2 nodes
2. Brute Force - Call brute_spanning_tree(list_of_vertices, list_of_edges, edges_in_tree).
3. Kruskal's Algorithm - Call algo_spanning_tree(list_of_vertices, list_of_edges, edges_in_tree).
