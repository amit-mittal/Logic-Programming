Assignment 1:
1.1 Implement heap-sort and quick-sort algorithm in C++.
    (a) Generate random inputs of large size and compute
        the time required to sort using both the algorithms.
    (b) Check correctness of output comparing the output
        generated by the two algorithms.

2.2 Write a C++ program that solves the following coin
    exchange program.

    Input: A list of coin denominations, say [d1, d2, ..., dn]
    and an amount v.

    Output: All possible ways of exchanging v using any number
    of coins given in the list.

    Example: [0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1]  v = 5
    Output
          [ 50, 0, 0, 0 ]
          [ 45, 0, 1, 0 ]
